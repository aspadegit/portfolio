        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            This was a group project that was made with <b>Angular</b> and involved <b>agile development</b>. Alaine was on the front-end team, and worked to integrate the website with its backend, which used Go.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website has a separate user and business login. It allows a user to sign up for classes, and businesses to create classes. These options interface with a backend that stores the data.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            This was a group project that was made with <b>Java socket programming</b>, and made heavy use of <b>threading</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is a peer-to-peer networking service, where several peers in a network can receive a single file via uploading their pieces to others, and downloading pieces they don't have from peers that do.
            More details can be found on the GitHub's readme.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            This was made with <b>C++</b>. The purpose of this project was to learn about file systems via reading and editing .WAD files, which is the file type that the video game DOOM is in.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project involved reading in the bytes of the WAD file and storing appropriate variables, then shifting bytes as necessary when writing to the WAD after adding files.
            Files could be added via a daemon that could traverse the directories in the WAD file as if it was a normal Linux directory.
