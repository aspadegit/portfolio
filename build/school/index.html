        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            This was a group project that was made with <b>Angular</b> and involved <b>agile development</b>. Alaine was on the front-end team, and worked to integrate the website with its back-end, which used Go.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the front-end, this website has a separate user and business login. Businesses can create classes, and users can sign up for classes that businesses make. 
            User accounts, business accounts, and classes are stored in the back-end.
        </p>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            This was a group project that was made with <b>Java socket programming</b>, and made heavy use of <b>threading</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is a peer-to-peer networking service, where several peers can communicate in a network to receive a single file. 
            Individual peers communicate which pieces of the file they have, and exchange those pieces with their fastest neighbors.
            More details can be found on the GitHub's readme.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            This was made with <b>C++</b>. The purpose of this project was to learn about file systems and memory management through reading and editing WAD files. WAD is the file extension that the video game DOOM is stored in.
        </p>
        <p>
            To read WAD files, the bytes of the file were traversed and stored in appropriate variables. 
            To edit WAD files, both the header bytes and lump data had to be written to, and bytes had to be shifted so that the WAD file maintained its proper structure.
            Files could be added via a daemon that could traverse the directories in the WAD file using the standard Linux command line functions.
        </p>
